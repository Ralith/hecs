error[E0495]: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for lifetime parameter `'a` due to conflicting requirements
 --> $DIR/wrong_lifetime.rs:3:10

note: first, the lifetime cannot outlive the lifetime `'a` as defined here...

note: ...so that the types are compatible

  = note: expected `Fetch<'a>`
             found `Fetch<'_>`
  = note: but, the lifetime must be valid for the static lifetime...
note: ...so that reference does not outlive borrowed content

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Query` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
